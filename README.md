xoopspartners
=============

The XoopsPartners module provides a page and a block for displaying links to the websites of cooperating organizations, together with short descriptions and optionally logos. Typical usage includes recognition of websites that refer a lot of traffic to your own and ‘thank you’ pages for sponsors.
