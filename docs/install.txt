INSTALL/UNINSTALL
=================

No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process -
extract the xoopspartners folder into the ../modules directory. Install the
module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.

Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the XOOPS Operations Manual (http://goo.gl/adT2i)

UPGRADE
=======

To upgrade from previous versions to v1.12 complete the following steps:
1. Go to Admin -> System -> Modules and Deactivate the XoopsPartners module
   (do not uninstall it unless you want to clear all partner data too).
2. Using an FTP client (or Cpanel in *nix installations) delete the
   ./module/xoopspartners directory and all it's contents (including
   all subdirectories) on your XOOPS installation.
3. Copy the ./xoopspartners directory and it's contents from the archive file
   (everything under the ./xoopspartners folder) to the ./modules folder on the
   server.
4. Go to Admin -> System -> Modules and update the XoopsPartners module.
5. Go back to Admin -> System -> Modules and Activate the module.
